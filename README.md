- <img width="901" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f20e56c-9433-49db-a494-724cfd0ae78c">
- Regardless, I was still able to upload a png file into the storage container by navigating back and uploading via the Azure portal
- <img width="952" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce6d9632-9699-43cb-8d89-e6e9cecbc332">
- And was able to preview the image just fine
- <img width="800" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66e0ebe8-a9ca-4815-be43-52668cacf463">
- When I tried renaming the 'test' file to '.env', it gave me an error message
- <img width="625" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22ef01cb-3df7-4d1d-9fe4-8fa10f054d70">
-  I made a new Colab notebook and that seemed to resolve the issue
-  Storage container was successfully listed
-  <img width="233" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f40cae13-eca7-4688-8fa4-a8b9856cd944">

-  The txt file was successfully uploaded into Azure

- Files in the storage container were lister (one txt file and two png)

- Link to Google Colab since it was giving me an error message on saving a copy on Github: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16YeML1zX7_bfyk8SdBgv8Hx-mI1SH9Op#scrollTo=kkmI0R68nJ4J


     

### GCP ###

- Bucket was created
- <img width="734" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a78a9a3-605c-4c34-beef-26e98e4cf645">
- A png file was uploaded
- <img width="413" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4515b84-cde7-46c9-9581-885f00cde63c">
- Since I was using Google colab, I uploaded the JSON file to the virtual file
- <img width="716" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73cd3479-c568-41c7-8852-be128fbe6666">
- I had to change the code used before step 4 to tailor it to the Google Colab environment I was using. Once I updated my storage permissions, I was able to upload the x-ray image from Google colab into GCP. The image was successfully uploaded
- <img width="584" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce1779bb-4f01-4bf8-9721-4fcb4f1c0e6d">
- <img width="595" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d01d4517-2767-48a4-897b-24ab71d0c3c9">
- I then went to test out if a fake image could be created into the same storage and it worked
- <img width="601" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05e5840b-aa1c-4a7d-95e3-bb02de6b9bb5">
- <img width="497" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f60ebf5-0f40-4536-908f-a94f3bb29d33">

- I'm not sharing the link because the Google colab file contains my JSON file. The code used was based on the repo provided and what was shown in the previous image
